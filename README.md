# Advent of Code

Doing [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com)

I say "reluctantly" because I got dragged into it by a friend midway through last year, and felt the need to follow through.

Despite this, I still intend to compete for fast times on the leaderboards.

All solutions are written in Javascript for now.

# Input

In general, all solutions can be invoked without command-line arguments.
Doing so runs the code on the input corresponding with my user.

Command-line interaction is possible to specify alternates.
Unless otherwise specified, pass one or more filenames containing the desired data, or `-` to use standard input.
