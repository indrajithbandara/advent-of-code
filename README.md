# Input

In general, all solutions can be invoked without command-line arguments.
Doing so runs the code on the input corresponding with my user.

Command-line interaction is possible to specify alternates.
Unless otherwise specified, pass one or more filenames containing the desired data, or `-` to use standard input.
